Build a program for calculating and returning the sums of absolute differences between adjacent numbers in arrays of positive integers. This must be calculated from the position determined by the current user.

In the case of this coding problem, you use three positional arguments through a findTotalSum function. The three inputs you would require are the number of elements inside the array, the elements in the array and the position from where this function will take place.

For example, suppose the total number of elements is 5 and these are the elements:

1 2 3 6 4

Then, if we decide to start from the 3rd position or enter 3 as input, the function will occur from ‘3’, the 3rd number in the array.


Hence, the sum would be a total of (6-3)+(4-6)= 5

Write a program to return the difference between the count of odd numbers and even numbers.

Note : You are expected to write code in the countOddEvenDifference function only which will receive the first parameter as the number of items in the array and second parameter as the array itself. you are not required to take input from the console.

Example
Finding the difference between the count of odd and even numbers from a list of 5  number

Input
input 1 : 8
input 2 : 10 20 30 40 55 66 77 83

Output
-2

```
Write a program to calculate and return the sum of absolute difference between the adjacent number in an array of positive integers from the position entered by the user.

Note : You are expected to write code in the findTotalSum function only which receive three positional arguments:

1st : number of elements in the array
2nd : array
3rd : position from where the sum is to be calculated

Example

Input
input 1 : 7
input 2 : 11 22 12 24 13 26 14
input 3 : 5

Output
25

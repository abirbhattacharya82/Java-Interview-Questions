Write a program to calculate and return the sum of absolute difference between the adjacent number in an array of positive integers from the position entered by the user.

Note : You are expected to write code in the findTotalSum function only which receive three positional arguments:

1st : number of elements in the array
2nd : array
3rd : position from where the sum is to be calculated

Example

Input
input 1 : 7
input 2 : 11 22 12 24 13 26 14
input 3 : 5

Output
25

Write a program to return the difference between the count of odd numbers and even numbers.

Note : You are expected to write code in the countOddEvenDifference function only which will receive the first parameter as the number of items in the array and second parameter as the array itself. you are not required to take input from the console.

Example
Finding the difference between the count of odd and even numbers from a list of 5  number

Input
input 1 : 8
input 2 : 10 20 30 40 55 66 77 83

A Cloth merchant has some pieces of cloth of different lengths. He has an order of curtains of length of 12 feet. He has to find how many curtains can  be made from these pieces. Length of pieces of cloth is recorded in feet.

Note : You are expected to write code in the findTotalCurtains function only which receive the first parameter as the number of items in the array and second parameter as the array itself. You are not required to take the input from the console.

Example

Finding the total curtains from a list of 5 cloth pieces.

Input
input 1 : 5
input 2 : 3 42 60 6 14

Output
9

Explanation
The first parameter 5 is the size of the array. Next is an array of measurements in feet. The total number of curtains is 5 which is calculated as under

3 -> 0
42 -> 3
60 -> 5
6 -> 0
14 -> 1
total = 9
